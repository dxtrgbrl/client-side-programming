		<h2 id="santorini-greece">Santorini Greece</h2>
			<img src="https://sothebysrealty.gr/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Santorini-sunset-at-dawn-Greece-Sothebys-International-Realty.jpg" alt= "Santorini Greece">
			<p>Santorini is an island-phenomenon whose reputation precedes it. And for good reason. On this legendary island in the Cyclades, all your senses seem magnified, a product of its many contrasts: black earth against whitewashed homes clinging to the cliff-side, or wild volcanic sculptures against sleek Cycladic lines. Also known as Thera in Greek, Santorini is an island immortalised by poets and painters thanks to its celebrated light, multicoloured cliffs and picture-perfect sunsets. If it’s always been your dream to visit Santorini, here is just the start of what awaits you.</p>

			<p>Vancouver Island, located on Canada’s West Coast, is known for its mild climate, abundance and relaxed way of life. This region is defined by its ancient rainforests, rugged coastlines, and cool waters of the Pacific Ocean, creating an abundance of outdoor recreation opportunities and peaceful getaways. Vancouver Island spans 460 kilometres long, from the provincial capital of Victoria to the far-reaching beaches of Cape Scott Provincial Park. Several small islands, the Gulf Islands and Discovery Islands, are found between the Salish Sea and Discovery Passage, respectively.</p>
		<h2 id="eiffel-tower">Eiffel Tower</h2>
			<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Tour_eiffel_paris-eiffel_tower.jpg" alt="Eiffel Tower">
			<p>The Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, which was to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the French Revolution. Its construction in 2 years, 2 months and 5 days was a veritable technical and architectural achievement. "Utopia achieved", a symbol of technological prowess, at the end of the 19th Century it was a demonstration of French engineering personified by Gustave Eiffel, and a defining moment of the industrial era. It was met immediately with tremendous success.</p>
		<h2 id="jasper-alberta">Jasper Alberta</h2>
			<img src="https://traveldigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jasper-National-Park-Canada-960x540.jpg" alt="Jasper Lake">
			<p>Before the Yellowhead Highway and Icefields Parkway started transporting people from around the world into the heart of the Canadian Rockies, before our beloved mountain town had even been dubbed ‘Jasper,’ this beautiful corner of the world was little more than a trading post surrounded by wilderness. Located along the Athabasca River (the primary highway of the day), this post was established and managed by two of Canada’s fur trading heavyweights: Hudson’s Bay Company and North West Company. The town and park would eventually get their name from one of the post’s managers and voyageur, Jasper Haws.</p>
		<h2 id="switzerland-lake">Lake Geneva</h2>
			<img src="https://cdn.audleytravel.com/1400/1000/60/15985926-geneva.jpg" alt="Lake Geneva and Hotels">
			<p>Lake Geneva is a water body of superlatives: mildest climate, largest lake and lake with the largest amount of water in Central Europe.The Celts called it “Large Water” or “Lem an”, and to this day it is called Lac Léman in French. And it certainly is big. Scheduled boats, historic paddle steamers and small ferries ply this 582km2 body of water, breaking records as they go. The Compagnie Générale de Navigation (GGN) on Lake Geneva operates eight paddle steamers, the largest European fleet of its kind. Shipping on Lake Geneva also breaks records.Regularly scheduled lake boats connect the numerous villages and cities, and small ferries, called "Mouettes", carry passengers in Geneva rapidly from one shore of the lake to another.</p>
		<h2 id="singapore">Singapore</h2>
			<img src="https://wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/singapore-wallpaper-28.jpg" alt="Singapore City">
			<p>Singapore, city-state located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, about 85 miles (137 kilometres) north of the Equator. It consists of the diamond-shaped Singapore Island and some 60 small islets; the main island occupies all but about 18 square miles of this combined area. The main island is separated from Peninsular Malaysia to the north by Johor Strait, a narrow channel crossed by a road and rail causeway that is more than half a mile long. The southern limits of the state run through Singapore Strait, where outliers of the Riau-Lingga Archipelago—which forms a part of Indonesia—extend to within 10 miles of the main island.</p>
